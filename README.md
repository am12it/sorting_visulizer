# Sorting Visualizer using c++


Implemented and developed an user-friendly Sorting Visualizer application using C++ for many
sorting algorithms such as Merge Sort, Selection Sort, Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Quick Sort.


# List of  These Sorting algorithem for Visulisation
- Use 0 to Generate a different randomized list.
- Use 1 to start Selection Sort Algorithm.
- Use 2 to start Insertion Sort Algorithm.
- Use 3 to start Bubble Sort Algorithm.
- Use 4 to start Merge Sort Algorithm.
- Use 5 to start Quick Sort Algorithm.
- Use q to exit out of Sorting Visualizer
